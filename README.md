# Buck-Boost-Converter

– Designed and implemented a Buck-Boost converter using TL494 in hardware for efficient voltage step-up and step-
down applications under varying input conditions.

– Integrated the TL494 PWM controller to generate precise switching signals for MOSFETs

– Demonstrated Discontinuous Conduction Mode in a DC-DC buck converter using frequency modulation via the
TL494 module.Also Proceeded with a similar software implementation in MATLAB Simulink

a) Specifications: Input 20 V, Output 15-25 V, Switching frequency 10 kHz, Output current 1 A.
Waveforms of diode current and switch voltage in CCM.

b) Reduce switching frequency to demonstrate DCM.
